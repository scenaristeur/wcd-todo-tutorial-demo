Imagine that you are a newcomer to the development team.

The team develops complex ready-to-use React components for various Web applications.

You were given the task of putting all the finished parts together in a small web application. 

Luckily, you will not have to write code to assemble all components because the team uses Webcodesk.

Webcodesk - a Web application builder.

Now you have the opportunity to build an application in the online version of Webcodesk.

> Unfortunately, the online version does not work on mobile devices.
